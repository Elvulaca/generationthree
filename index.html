            <p>A third-generation programming language is a high-level computer programming language that tends to be more machine-independent and programmer-friendly than the machine code of the first-generation and assembly languages of the second-generation,
                while having a less specific focus to the fourth and fifth generations. Examples of common and historical third-generation programming languages are ALGOL, BASIC, C, COBOL, Fortran, Java, and Pascal.

            <li>Smaller in size</li>
            <li>Used less energy</li>
            <li>More reliable</li>
            <li>Produced less heat than Gen 1 and Gen 2
            </li>
            <li>Better speed and could calculate data in nanoseconds</li>
            <li>Maintenance cost was low because hardware failure is rare</li>
